# MicroLearn

MicroLearn is a "microlearning" mobile application that sends the user a daily one page (a portion of material that does not exceed a certain volume and has a complete thought) on a topic they want to learn.
"Microlearning" is a well-established term that represents learning a small amount of material in a short period of time. Most often, the term is used in electronic learning formats. Microlearning as an approach is the concept of absorbing any knowledge in small units.
So, the idea of the application is that the user subscribes to a topic (one or more), and every day receives one unread "portion" from each topic to which he is subscribed. The user will also be able to customize the profile (edit the list of topics, change the name and profile photo).

## UI prototype
User interface was modeled in Figma. It can be found through that [link](https://www.figma.com/file/4WIe06GwD4EnX5gJHU49wM/MicroLearn?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=7cS0ioMRxxCUnFtT-1).

## Versions
![Version 0.55](https://img.shields.io/badge/Version0.55-974060?) - realisation of the main prototype of user interface (all pages that were prototyped in Figma) using xml-files in the environment of *Android Studio*, connected database SQLite and primary AI functions.

## Planned next step
Realisation of secondary UI pages and connection Firebase

## Files
All main kotlin classes are located in path:
```bash
app/src/main/java/kd/microlearn
```
